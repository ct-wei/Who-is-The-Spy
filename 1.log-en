Let’s play a reasoning game called "Who is the Spy?". 

<Basic rules>:  
<Players>: 4 people.  
<Role assignment>: Each player is randomly assigned a word. Three players will receive the same word (civilian word), while one player will receive a similar but different word (undercover word).  
<Game flow>:
  1. Players take turns describing their word but <must not> directly say the word itself.  
  2. After all players describe, vote for the player who seems most likely to be the Spy.  
  3. At the end of each round, the player with the most votes is eliminated and can no longer describe or vote.  
  4. The game ends when:  
     - If the Spy is identified, the civilians win.  
     - If the Spy is not identified and their number equals or exceeds the civilians, the Spy wins.  

You will play as a <player>. Please wait to be assigned your keyword.

Your assigned keyword is: **fruit**.  

You may now start the game. Remember, your goal is to avoid being voted out while helping your teammates identify the Spy. Describe your word without directly mentioning "fruit," using indirect descriptions instead. For example:  
"This is a common food that can be eaten raw or cooked, available in many colors and shapes."  
After your description, other players will vote based on your explanation. Good luck!

As Player 1, my description of my keyword "Homeroom Teacher":  

"They are usually responsible for maintaining discipline in the class and act as a bridge between students and teachers. They grade assignments daily, care about students’ learning and well-being, and sometimes organize extracurricular activities. In our memories, they might be strict or kindhearted."

You cannot directly state the keyword itself. Please describe it again.

Apologies, let me rephrase:  

"This role plays an essential management part on campus. They maintain order and are trusted advisors for teachers and classmates. They often wear uniforms, busying themselves between classrooms and offices. They serve as a link between students and school leadership."

They often wear uniforms, busying themselves between classrooms and offices. They serve as a link between students and school leadership."  

Player 2 said:  

"Got it, I will try again to avoid directly referencing the keyword. My description is as follows:  

'In schools, there are people who take on important responsibilities for managing students' daily activities. They usually wear uniform clothing, moving actively between classrooms and offices. They are key guides for students, not only teaching knowledge but also caring for their growth and mental health. They are a bridge between school and home, having a profound impact on students' holistic development.'"

Player 3 said:  

"Certainly, I will rephrase my description:  

'In the corners of the campus, there are people who patiently listen and carefully guide. They are not on the podium teaching but often in offices solving students' problems. They are both mentors to students and participants in school decisions. With their knowledge and experience, they provide students with direction. Their presence is crucial to students' development, yet often unnoticed.'"  

Player 4 said:  

"Certainly, I will rephrase:  

'In schools, this role combines management and guidance duties. They often move between classrooms and offices, showing close care for students’ studies and lives. They are not only authoritative figures in the eyes of students but also bridges for communication between school and family. Their presence is like a compass in the school, guiding students in the ocean of knowledge.'"
