Let’s play a reasoning game called "Who is the Spy?". 

<Basic rules>:  
<Players>: 4 people.  
<Role assignment>: Each player is randomly assigned a word. Three players will receive the same word (civilian word), while one player will receive a similar but different word (undercover word).  
<Game flow>:
  1. Players take turns describing their word but <must not> directly say the word itself.  
  2. After all players describe, vote for the player who seems most likely to be the Spy.  
  3. At the end of each round, the player with the most votes is eliminated and can no longer describe or vote.  
  4. The game ends when:  
     - If the Spy is identified, the civilians win.  
     - If the Spy is not identified and their number equals or exceeds the civilians, the Spy wins.  

You will play as a <player>. Please wait to be assigned your keyword.

Okay, I am now playing as a player. I will randomly assign you a keyword. Please wait a moment. [Assigning keyword...]  

Keyword: **"Mysterious Figure"**  

Now that you have your keyword, "Mysterious Figure," you may begin describing your word, but remember not to directly state "Mysterious Figure." It's your turn to describe.

Player 1 said: Sorry, let me rephrase:  

“This character plays an important managerial role on campus. They maintain order and are trusted advisors to both teachers and students. They often wear uniforms and are busy every day shuttling between classrooms and offices, acting as a bridge between students and school leadership.”  

Player 2 said: Understood, I will try again to avoid directly mentioning the keyword. My description is:  

“In schools, there is a group of people who take on the important responsibility of managing students' daily activities. They usually wear uniforms and are active in classrooms and offices. They are key guides in students' learning and lives, imparting knowledge and caring about their growth and mental health. They are also a bridge between schools and families, having a profound impact on students’ overall development.”  

Player 3 said: Certainly, let me rephrase:  

“In the corners of campuses, there is a group of people who are always patient listeners and thoughtful guides. They don’t teach from the podium but are often in offices helping students solve problems. They are both mentors to students and participants in school decisions. They use their knowledge and experience to provide students with direction. Their presence is essential to students' growth, though often unnoticed.”  

You are Player 4. Your assigned keyword is: <Class Teacher>. Please start describing.**

As Player 4, my keyword is “Class Teacher.” Here’s my description:  

“In the daily operation of a school, there is this role. They are not only transmitters of knowledge but also guardians of students’ minds. They are more than just classroom teachers—they are lifelong mentors to students. They shuttle between classrooms and offices every day, patiently answering students’ questions and caring for their studies and lives. They focus not only on academic achievements but also on cultivating students’ character and personality. Their work seems ordinary, but it has an immeasurable impact...”**

You cannot directly state the word itself. Please rephrase your description.**

Certainly, I’ll rephrase:  

“In schools, there is such a role. They take on both management and guidance duties. They frequently move between classrooms and offices, closely caring for students’ studies and lives. They are not only seen as authorities by students but also serve as bridges between schools and families. Their presence is like an indispensable compass on campus, guiding students through the sea of knowledge.”**
