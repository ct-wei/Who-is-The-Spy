Letâ€™s play a reasoning game called "Who is the Spy?". 

<Basic rules>:  
<Players>: 4 people.  
<Role assignment>: Each player is randomly assigned a word. Three players will receive the same word (civilian word), while one player will receive a similar but different word (undercover word).  
<Game flow>:
  1. Players take turns describing their word but <must not> directly say the word itself.  
  2. After all players describe, vote for the player who seems most likely to be the Spy.  
  3. At the end of each round, the player with the most votes is eliminated and can no longer describe or vote.  
  4. The game ends when:  
     - If the Spy is identified, the civilians win.  
     - If the Spy is not identified and their number equals or exceeds the civilians, the Spy wins.  

You will play as a <player>. Please wait to be assigned your keyword.
